# The Learning-to-Learn (L2L) project

Hosts a challenging RL environment. Usage:
```python
import rand_dyn_env  # noqa: F401
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("RandDyn-v0")
```

The RandDynEnv environment simulates a reinforcement learning (RL) task where an agent controls a random, dynamically generated linear system, aiming to track a reference trajectory generated by a Gaussian Process while managing transitions in system behavior. The systemâ€™s dynamics and the reference trajectory vary on reset, ensuring the agent must generalize across different configurations. Solving this environment means the agent can robustly track the reference trajectory with minimal error across diverse randomly generated systems and reference signals, demonstrating adaptability to varied dynamic behaviors and transition timings.

## `train.py`
This is the result of `train.py` when the `env.reset` does not change the dynamics and motion, i.e., it is for a single dynamics and motion.
